is a type of [line graph](/line-graph) for multiple categories with only two data points. Slopegraphs are a way of showing change along two axes by means of a connecting line and comparing those changes across multiple categorise. 

<!--more-->
Slopegraphs were introduced by Edward Tufte in his book *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* (1983), calling is a "table-graphic" that organizes data both vertically and horizontally. 

A list of categories appears vertically followed with categories ranked based on the initial data point. 

Slopegraphs compare changes, usually over time or at equal intervals.  A two-point line slope is displayed for each category. Multiple slopes can be presented per category. Next the categories are reordered in the list on the right based on their rank. The numeric values for each interval is marked as number. The numbers are positioned along the Y axis but the axis itself is not shown. 

Slopegraphs are similar to [bump charts](bump-chart) in that both display categories in a ranked order. The different is that in a bump chart numeric values are not positioned on the Y axis but only the rank is reflected.
