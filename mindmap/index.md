is a type of knowledge representation that shows concepts as nodes and links between them as connecting lines forming an overall outward-branching hierarchical structure.[^plotnik] A mind map usually starts from a single concept at the center of the image. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and minor ideas branch out from those major ideas. Mind maps are used to as a mnemonic technique for facts and their interconnections.

The mind map has ancient origins with the earliest known example being the The Tree of Porphyry or the Porphyrian tree created by the 3rd century CE Greek philosopher and logician Porphyry. [^cyclopedia] Although the Porphyrian tree had no connecting lines yet, it already used spatial mapping. In the 1970s, American educator Joseph D. Novak introduced the term "concept mapping". The term "mind-mapping" appeared in the 1970s popularized by British author Tony Buzan along with the idea of mental literacy.[^buzan]

Concept maps and mind maps are similar in structure and purpose, the main difference being the presence of connecting words and phrases along the connecting lines in a concept map.

The process of making a mind map starts with a list of concepts made in a brainstorming session. The concepts are then organized in hierarchical order and connectors are added. [^novak2]

Mind-mapping has been studied as a learning technique that could improve recall and critical-thinking skills.[^novak] Mind-mapping was shown to improve long-term recall by 10%.[^farrand] In a study with medical students taking notes using a mind-mapping technique, it was not found to increase short-term recall or critical thinking compared to students taking written notes.[^antoni]
