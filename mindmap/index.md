is a type of knowledge representation that shows concepts as nodes and links between them as connecting lines forming an overall outward-branching hierarchical structure.[^plotnik]

<!--more-->

A mind map usually starts from a single concept at the center of the image that represents the ***main topic*** of the visualization. ***Sub-topics*** are connected directly to the main topic, representing the main themes of the mindmap. Minor themes or specific ***ideas*** branch out from the sub-topics. 

Mind maps serve as a mnemonic technique for facts and their interconnections.

The mind map has ancient origins with the earliest known example being The Tree of Porphyr, or the Porphyrian tree, created by the 3rd century CE Greek philosopher and logician Porphyry. [^cyclopedia] 

Although the Porphyrian tree had no connecting lines yet, it already used spatial mapping. In the 1970s, American educator Joseph D. Novak introduced the term "concept mapping." Mind-mapping appeared in the 1970s popularized by British author Tony Buzan along with the idea of mental literacy.[^buzan]

Mind maps are similar in structure and purpose to [concept maps](/concept-map), the main difference being the presence of connecting words and phrases along the connecting lines in a concept map.

The process of making a mind map starts with a list of concepts created during a brainstorming session. The concepts then appear in the mind map in hierarchical order with connecting lines drawn between concept. [^novak2]

Mind-mapping is as a learning technique with the potential to improve recall and critical-thinking skills.[^novak] Mind-mapping was shown to improve long-term recall by 10%.[^farrand] In a study with medical students taking notes in class, mind-mapping did not increase either short-term recall or critical thinking compared to students taking written notes.[^antoni] 

## Alternatives

1. [Concept map](/concept-map) is a diagram representing ideas and their connections as a network of nodes and links with each link labeled with a description of the type of relationship.
2. [Flowchart](/flowchart) represents the sequence of events in any operation using nodes and links.
3. [Word cloud](/word-cloud) representation of the frequency of words in a given text by using the size of the font.
