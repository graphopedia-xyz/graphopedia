is a type of map that substitutes land area with time, population or any other variable, thus distorting the geometry of the map.

## Origin
Candlestick charts were first described by a wealthy Japanese rice trader Munehisa Homma, who wrote 160 rules describing various patterns of trading.

## Variations
1. The Density-Equalizing Cartogram - map features bulge to show a specific variable. 
2. The Non-Contiguous Cartogram - map features are split from each other to emphasize the difference in size.
3. The Dorling Cartogram - shapes such a circles or sexagons make are used to mimic the features of a map.
