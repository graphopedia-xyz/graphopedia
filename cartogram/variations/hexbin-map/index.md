represents entire regions or their sub-divisions as adjacent hexagonal tiles. Hexagons have an advantage over rectangles and circles because they can show adjacency more accurately, having 6 six sides. The area of a hexagon is less evident to a reader than square area, but hexagons pack into shapes that more accurately approximate actual map region areas.
