is a type of knowledge representation that shows concepts as nodes and links between them as connecting lines forming an overall outward-branching hierarchical structure.[^plotnik] 

<!--more-->

The term "concept map" was coined in the 1970s by American educator Joseph D. Novak. A concept map usually starts from a single concept node at the top of the image. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept with their and minor concepts branching out from them. Each connecting line is labeled, usually with a verb, describing the type of connection. Concept maps are used as a learning tool for remembering facts with their interconnections.

Concept maps and [mind maps](/mind-map) are similar in structure and purpose with the two main differences being the presence of connecting words and phrases along the connecting lines in a concept map and the concept map starting from the top and not from the center like the mind map.

The process of making a concept map starts with a list of concepts made in a brainstorming session. The concepts are then organized in hierarchical order and connectors are added. [^novak2] The connectors can be ini-directional and bi-directional.

Concept mapping has been studied as a learning technique that could improve recall and critical-thinking skills.[^novak]
