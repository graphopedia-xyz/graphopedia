visualizes data with multiple variables mapped on radial axes.[^friendly]
Data in a radar chart must have at least three variables because the simplest shape made by the radar chart is a triangle. Each radial axis represents one variable. All variables are independent of one another, allowing each axis to have a different scale. All the axes are positioned at equal angles.

<!--more-->
The values are presented as dots on the axes, with the length from the center showing the value. A connecting line joints the data points which make up a star or polygon shape. The polygons partially overlap with the non-overlapping parts showing the differences and outliers. This feature allows the comparison of a lot of variables at a glance. 

Functionally, the radar chart is the same as [parallel coordinates](/parallel-coordinates) except set in polar coordinates.

Radar charts are suitable for showing general trends, outliers, and commonality. At the same time, the radar chart has disadvantages because of its limited ability to relate exact values.  As with all other radial charts or charts set in polar coordinates, it is less readable than its linear counterparts.[^nist]
