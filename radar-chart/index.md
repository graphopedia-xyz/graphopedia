is a graphical method of showing multivariate data from three or more variables (because the simplest shape is a triangle) represented on radial axes. The radar chart consists of a sequence spokes positioned at the same angle from each other (equi-angular). Each spoke represents one of the variables. The values are presented as dots on the axes, with the length showing the value. A line is drawn connecting the data values which makes up a star or polygon shape. This feature makes the comparison of variables at a glance possible. However, the polar chart is limited to showing only general trends, outliers, and commonality.

Radar chars, as all other radial charts, are less readable than linear charts.[^1]
