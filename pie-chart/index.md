---

is type of graph that shows the sizes of components relative to each other and relative to the whole. The whole circle represents 100%, while the wedge-shaped segments represent the percentage that is equal to their arc lengths. Pie charts are criticized for their over use because human perception is not capable of accurately comparing wedge-shaped slices. Charts that are based on rectangular shapes are thought to be easier to perceive, especially when specific value need to be seen in the charts by the viewer. Among the alternative to a pie chart are the bar chart or stacked bar chart and the waffle chart. Pie charts are best used to show value of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Smaller values are difficult for viewers to estimate. Fractions such at 38.5% and unrounded numbers such as 38% are virtually impossible to see on a pie chart.

## Origin

Scottish engineer William Playfair is credited as the first creator of the pie chart published in *Statistical Breviary* in 1801. However, Playfair's invention was not popular as first. In 1856, the French engineer Charles Joseph Minard, who is also the creator of one of the most well-known Sankey diagrams on Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, was one of the first to use pie charts on a map to represent who much cattle each French region sent to Paris for consumption.

## Variations
1. **Doughnut chart** is a pie chart with the center cut. Doughnut charts are used to reduce the amount on ink on a page, especially when showing many pie charts side by side.
2. **Exploded pie chart** is a stylistic variation of pie chart with one or several of the wedges shifted equally outward from the center. The intended effect is emphasis of the size of the "exploded" wedge. However, this technique may be counter-productive since stand alone wedges are not easier to compare with the rest of the wedge.
3. **Polar area chart** (also known as coxcomb chart or Nightnighgale chart) is a type of pie chart in which all sectors have equal angles but they differ in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle. The polar area chart is used to plot cyclic phenomena, for example, the amount of rain each month would be plotted as 12 sectors at 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector is proportional to the square root of the death count for the month. The area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month. The polar area chart is famously developed by English nurse Florence Nightingale.
4. **Windrose chart** is a type of polar area chart that shows the speed and direction of winds at a given location. The length of each "spoke" around the circle indicates the amount of time that the wind blows from a particular direction. Colors along the spokes indicate categories of wind speed. 
5. **Stacked pie chart** or *nested pie chart* is a group of pie charts that are positioned concentrically.
