  - circular chart

---

is type of graph that shows the sizes of components relative to each other and relative to the whole. The whole circle represents 100%, while the wedge-shaped segments represent the percentage that is equal to their arc lengths. The function of a pie chart is the visual illustration of part-to-whole relationships.

Scottish engineer William Playfair is credited as the first creator of the pie chart published in *Statistical Breviary* in 1801. However, Playfair's invention was not popular as first. In 1856, the French engineer Charles Joseph Minard, who is also the creator of one of the most well-known [Sankey chart](/sankey-chart), was one of the first to use pie charts on a map to represent who much cattle each French region sent to Paris for consumption. [^spence]

Pie charts are criticized for their over use because human perception is not capable of accurately comparing wedge-shaped slices.[^tufte] Charts that are based on rectangular shapes are thought to be easier to perceive, especially when specific value need to be seen in the charts by the viewer.

Pie charts should not be used to represent sums of parts where the sum is not meaningful to the reader. For example, showing the total number of goals across several soccer teams would not be meaningful because it makes sense to compare them not ro add. [^good]
 
 Pie charts are best used to show values of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Smaller values are difficult for viewers to estimate. Fractions such as 38.5% and unrounded numbers such as 38% are virtually impossible to see on a pie chart.
 
 Pie charts are one of the most popular types of data visualization,[^] likely to human predisposition towards circles and radiating patterns.[^lima]

## Variations
Many stylistic variations of the pie chart exist. Since the size a segment of a circle is difficult for a human eye to compare, techniques such as exploding the pie chart try to separate the segments for easier comparison. However, there is evidence that distorting the basic pie chart only makes reading it more difficult. [^kosara]

1. **Doughnut chart** is a pie chart with the center cut. Doughnut charts are used to reduce the amount on ink on a page, especially when showing many pie charts side by side.
2. **Exploded pie chart** is a stylistic variation of pie chart with one or several of the wedges shifted equally outward from the center. The intended effect is emphasis of the size of the "exploded" wedge. However, this technique may be counter-productive since stand alone wedges are not easier to compare with the rest of the wedge.
3. **Stacked pie chart** or *nested pie chart* is a group of pie charts that are positioned concentrically.

## Alternatives
1. [*Stacked Bar Chart*](/bar-chart) a pie chart is essentially a stacked bar chart with a single bar shown in polar coordinates.[^wilkinson] Functionally absolutely the same, but the bar chart rectangles give readers an easier way to judge the areas.
2. [*Polar area chart*](/polar-area-chart) is a type of pie chart in which all sectors have equal angles but they differ in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle. The polar area chart is used to plot cyclic phenomena, for example, the amount of rain each month would be plotted as 12 sectors at 30 degrees each.
