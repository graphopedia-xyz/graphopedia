is a type of [bar chart](/bar-chart) that shows the progress of events over time and their inter-dependencies, usually in the context of project management. 
<!--more-->
Each event in a Gantt chart displays its timeline, the person or team who whom it is assigned, and any connections to other events or projects.

A task appears as a ***task bar***, the length of which shows the task duration. The bars run horizontally along a ***timeline*** which is displayed on the horizontal axis. 

The scale of the timeline can measure in days, weeks, quarters, or years. The tasks typically appear in the order of priority such that tasks to be completed first are at the top.

A disadvantage of using a Gantt chart is that it does not show all the possible connections between events within a project as, for example, in a [network diagram](/network-diagram).[^wisocki] Another disadvantage is that the collaboration between members of the project team is not visualized.

The Gantt chart was introduced in the 1910s by American engineer Henry Gantt. [^wallace]

## Alternatives
For project management use cases, other chart types can show more detailed interactions between issues and people. These charts emphasize how people, resources, and events relate to each other.
Another reason to choose an alternative to a Gantt chart is the absence of means to display expected project completion time.

1. [*Network diagram*](/network-diagram) uses nodes and links to show the hierarchy and connections between entities.
2. *PERT chart* shows the likely completion time for a project. There four types of time:  1. optimistic time - the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity, assuming everything proceeds better than is typically expected; 2. pessimistic time - the maximum possible time required to finish an activity, assuming everything goes wrong (excluding major catastrophes); 3. likely time - the best estimate of the time necessary to complete an activity, assuming everything goes as normal; 4. expected time - the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an a task, accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as expected.
