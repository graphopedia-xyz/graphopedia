is a graphical representation of the relationships between three numeric variables in two dimensions. It is a specialized type of graph that uses contour lines to depict the values of the three variables at different points in the x-y plane.

In a contour plot, the x- and y-axes represent the two dimensions of the graph, while the contour lines represent the values of the third variable. The contour lines are typically labeled with the corresponding values, and different colors or line styles can be used to distinguish between different contour levels or data ranges.

Contour plots are often used to visualize and analyze data in fields such as engineering, meteorology, and geophysics, as they provide a clear and concise way to visualize the relationships between variables and the distribution of data in two dimensions. They can also be used to identify patterns, trends, and areas of high or low concentration in the data.
