is a type of table that shows the frequency of elements occurring in relation to certain numbers. The stem is a single number or number range that defines a class, and the leaves are the multiples numbers that occur in that class.

A stem-and-leaf plot consists of two columns, usually separated by a vertical line. The left column contains the stems and the right column contains the leaves.

Stemplots are an alternative way of showing a frequency distribution table or a histogram. The distinguishing feature of a stem-and-leaf plot is that it shows the actual number values.
