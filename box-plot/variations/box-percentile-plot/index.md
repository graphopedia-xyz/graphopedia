uses both sides of the box plot to show the distribution at each point. For each point in the plot, the box width is proportional to the percentile of that data value, up to 50th percentile. After that, it switches to being proportional to values outside the percentile. The plot is symmetrical. The upper quartile, median, and lower quartile are marked with a line. Similarly to a violin plot, the advantages of this plot is that it covers the entire range of data.[^esty]
