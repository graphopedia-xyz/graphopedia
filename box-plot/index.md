A box plot is a type of graph that shows the 5-number summary of a group of data which consists of the minimum and maximum range values, the upper and lower quartiles, and the median. The middle band always represents
the median. The ends of the whiskers can represent different different types of values.

Here are the possibilities:
- minimum and maximum of all data
- one standard deviation above and below the mean
- the 9th percentile and the 91st percentile
- the 2nd percentile and the 98th percentile

The outliers are plotted as dots outside of the whiskers.

### Origin
The box plot was first introduced in 1970 by American Statistician John Tukey who early in his career worked on developing statistical methods for computers at Bell Labs where he invented the term "bit".

### Variations
1. Vase plot - the box is replaced with a symmetrical shape that shows of estimated density.
2. Violin plot -  display the density for all data points, not just the middle half.
3. Bean plot - a simplification of the box plot intended for the non-mathematicians where the individual observations are shown as small lines in a one-dimensional scatter plot.
