shows the distribution of data from its minimum to its maximum values, the upper and lower quartiles, and the median. The middle band always represents
the median which means that 505 of data is above the live and the other 50% is below. Outliers are plotted outside the box and whiskers as dots. The ends of the whiskers can represent different different types of values.

The box plot was first introduced in 1970 by American Statistician John Tukey who early in his career worked on developing statistical methods for computers at Bell Labs where he invented the term "bit".


## Purpose
Box plots show variation, distribution, and uncertainty. A single box in a box plot can show distribution of numbers just like a histogram would. Since boxes are compact, box plots can easily show comparisons between distributions. 



## Usage
You can use a box plot to showing the following types of data:

- minimums and maximums
- one standard deviation above and below the mean
- the 9th percentile and the 91st percentile
- the 2nd percentile and the 98th percentile

The outliers are plotted as dots outside of the whiskers.

## Variations
1. Vase plot - the box is replaced with a symmetrical shape that shows of estimated density.
2. [*Violin plot*](/violion-plot) displays the density for all data points, not just the middle half.
3. Bean plot - a simplification of the box plot intended for the non-mathematicians where the individual observations are shown as small lines in a one-dimensional scatter plot.
4. Beeswarm Plot
