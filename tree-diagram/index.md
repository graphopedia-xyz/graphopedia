Alternative names: tree chart, tree structure, org chart

Tree diagrams represent a series of independent events or conditional probabilities. Each node represents an event. Each parent node precedes its child nodes in sequence and its sibling nodes represents events of the same importance or occurring at the same time. The chart is named for its resemblance to a tree even those the most common tree diagrams direct the tree upside down or to the side.

#### Use Cases
Tree diagrams are used to show hierarchies without numeric values attached to any of the members. There non-numeric types of charts include:
1. Organization charts - showing the organizational structure of a company or an institution
2. Family trees - showing the ancestors or descendants
3. Classification - showing a taxonomy of categories in a given field
