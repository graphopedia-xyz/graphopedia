The tree structure in information graphics is used as a metaphor to depict the hierarchies of concepts and ideas. The most common of the metaphorical trees are *the knowledge tree* and *the tree of life*. In this case, the tree diagram is often stylized to resemble trees, rivers, roots, or other natural objects, especially where the illustration fits the subject matter. [^lima]
