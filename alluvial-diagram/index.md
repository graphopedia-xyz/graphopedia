is a type of graph that shows changes in the amount of flow between entities as the thickness of a line. Alluvial diagrams can be considered a type of [network diagram](/network-diagram) that shows changes in network structure over time. 
<!--more-->


In an alluvial diagram, ***categories*** are represented as boxes from which the flow lines originate. 

Each ***flow line*** represents a variable, and its thickness at any point - its value. Where flow lines re-***cluster***, a new box forms. All lines can both split and merge back into the flow. The box width is scaled according to the number of incoming flow lines and their widths. 
 
The X-axis and Y-axis are normally not shown with only the category labels appearing next to the bands. Typically, the direction of the flow lines represents time. Importantly, the clusters have to appear in the temporal order. [^borner]
The diagram begins and ends with the boxes reflecting the current composition of the categories.
 
The alluvial diagram first appeared in 2010[^rosvall] defined as showing "changes in the clustering structure from one period to the next are represented by the mergers and divergences that occur in the ribbons linking the blocks." 

Alluvial diagrams can also be considered a variant of [parallel coordinates plot](/parallel-coordinates) for categorical variables. [^kosara]

The terms *Sankey diagram* and *alluvial diagram* are sometimes used to refer to the same type of chart, for example by D3 creator Mick Bostock [^bostock] and author Andy Kirk. [^kirk]
Unlike [Sankey diagrams](/sankey-chart), alluvial diagrams can re-cluster the streams.

## Alternatives

1. [*Chord diagram*](/chord-diagram) represents weighted relationships between categories. Unlike the alluvial diagram, it does not show the change over time, but a single snapshot in time. Another requirement is that all categories have to be of the same type. For example, a chord diagram can show connections between countries but not between countries and cities.
2. [*Tree diagram*](/tree-diagram) displays a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes and links.
