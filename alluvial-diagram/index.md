The <dfn>alluvial diagram</dfn> is a type of network diagram that shows the change of flow structure over time as well as its magnituge at any point in time. The alluvial diagram is a type of Sankey diagram, the difference between the two being that an alluvial diagram allows for re-clustering of nodes at any point in time. 

The blocks in an alluvial diagram represent clusters of nodes. The stream lines between the blocks represent changes in the composition of these clusters over time. The height of a block represents the size of the cluster and the height of a stream line shows the size of the component.

Note: You may see the terms <dfn>sankey diagram<dfn> and <dfn>alluvial diagram</dfn> [used to refer](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/) to the same type of chart.
