is a type of a tree diagram that represents hierarchies and clustering. The root node of the dendrogram represents the whole data set and the top of the hierarchy. Each leaf node is one step lower in hierarchy. 
The intermediate nodes between any two levels of the hierarchy describe the extent that the nodes are removed from each other in the hierarchy or in other words the degree of their dissimilarity.[^] The height of the dendrogram represents the distance between each pair of clusters.

***Purpose*** showing hierarchy and clustering
***Data type*** multivariate (three or more variables)

## Usage
Dendrograms are used in genetics to show the pairing of genes. Heatmaps are often used in combination with dendrograms.
 dendrograms are also used in sports to illustrate the results of elimination tournaments.
 
 Dendrograms can have horizontal, vertical orientation. The layout can be linear or circular.
