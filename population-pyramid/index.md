population pyramid is a pair of [histograms](/histogram) positioned back to back symmetrically along the vertical access. The right and left sides mirror each other except in one variable, usually gender. The symmetry gives the advantage of visual comparison between the lengths of bars on both sides.

Populations pyramids are popular as a demographic visualization. Its application has been extended to other uses such as gender statistics for other fields. 

The population pyramid is normally mirrored along the Y axis, but it can have a horizontal mirroring as well. The X axis is then split into two equal parts with zero point in the middle of the X axis. 

Percentages or quantities are plotted on the X axis and the age groups on the Y axis. If percentages are plotted on the X axis, the values of all the bars should add up to 100%. Normally, age is shown from 0 to 100.

For making comparisons populations at different points in time, the contour trace of the "past" population pyramid is superimposed on top of the current one. In this case, it is better to use percentages rather than actual values.

For comparison of populations, it is possible to display population pyramids as [small multiples](/small-multiples).
