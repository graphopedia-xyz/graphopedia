is a pair of [histograms](/histogram) positioned back to back symmetrically along the vertical axis. The right and left sides mirror each other except in one variable, usually gender. The symmetry enables visual comparison between the lengths of bars on both sides.

Populations pyramids are popular as a demographic visualization. Their application now includes other uses such as gender statistics. 

The population pyramid usually is mirrored along the Y-axis, but it can have horizontal mirroring as well. The X-axis then splits into two equal parts with the zero point in the middle. 

Percentages or quantities appear on the X-axis and the age groups on the Y-axis. If percentages are plotted on the X-axis, the values of all the bars should add up to 100%. Typically, age spans from 0 to 100.

For making comparisons populations at different points in time, the contour trace of the "past" population pyramid is superimposed on top of the current one. In this case, it is better to use percentages rather than actual values.

For comparison of populations, it is possible to display population pyramids as [small multiples](/small-multiples).
