is a pair of [histograms](/histogram) positioned back to back symmetrically along the vertical axis. The right and left sides mirror each other except in one variable, usually gender. The symmetry enables visual comparison between the lengths of bars on both sides.

The population pyramid is mirrored along one of its ***numeric axes*** that shows age, usually ranging from 1 to 100 years. The other numeric axis is typically expressed in either percentages or counts. This axis has its ***zero point*** in the middle. Each side of the pyramid represents a separate ***category*** in the data. Typically, the two categories refer to male and female gender.

Percentages or quantities appear on the X-axis and the age groups on the Y-axis. If percentages are plotted on the X-axis, the values of all the bars should add up to 100%.

For making comparisons populations at different points in time, the contour trace of the "past" population pyramid is superimposed on top of the current one. In this case, it is better to use percentages rather than actual values.

Populations pyramids are a popular form of demographic visualization. Their application now includes other uses such as gender statistics.

For comparison of populations, it is possible to display population pyramids as [small multiples](/small-multiples).
