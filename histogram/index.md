is a graphic representation of the distribution of data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable/ It is similar to a density plot and a bar chart. Unlike a density plot, a histogram shows discrete values. Unlike a bar chart, a histogram only shows one variable. The vertical axis in a histogram always shows frequency, not another variable as would be the case in a bar chart.

## Origin
The histogram was first introduced by English mathematician and biostatistician Karl Pearson in 1895. (Pearson is also the author of *The Grammar of Science*, the book recommended by Albert Einstein to his friends of the Olympia Academy.)
