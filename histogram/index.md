is a graphic representation of the distribution of data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable. It is similar to a density plot and a bar chart. Unlike a density plot, a histogram shows discrete values. Unlike a bar chart, a histogram only shows one variable. The vertical axis in a histogram always shows frequency, not another variable as would be the case in a bar chart.

<!--more-->
The histogram was first introduced by English mathematician and biostatistician Karl Pearson in 1895. (Pearson is also the author of *The Grammar of Science*, the book recommended by Albert Einstein to his friends of the Olympia Academy.)

To see how raw data i transformed into a histogram, see this [interactive visualization on how histograms work](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms).

## Alternatives
The alternatives to the histogram, the chart almost synonymous with distribution, are going to be other charts that show distribution.
1. *Dot plot* also known as *unit chart* shows individual data points for each point in time plotted on the x-axis.
2. *Barcode chart*
3. *Beeswarm plot*
4. *Density plot*
5. *Strip plot*
6. *Violin plot*
