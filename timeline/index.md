is a type of chart that display events in chronological order. Timelines can represent time to scale or only represent the sequence of events at equal intervals. Timelines covering a relatively small span of time use a linear scale. For distant events in the past of the future, a logarithmic scale is used.

Joseph Priestley’s 1765 Chart of Biography is cited as the most influential timeline of the 18th century that  had the first “complete and fully theorized visual vocabulary for a time map, and was the first to compete with the matrix as a normative structure for representing regular chronology”. [^grafton]

A timeline uses a line to represent the flow of time and symbols on that line to represent events. The event are positioned in chronological order, spaced either to reflect the time elapsed between events or spaced at equal interval to only reflect the sequence of events.

The orientation of the timeline can be vertical, horizontal, curved, perspective, and spiral.  The *vertical timeline* shows past events at the top and future at the bottom of the page. The *horizontal timeline* runs from left to right. The *curved timeline* runs from left to right and top to bottom, following the standard reading direction. The *spiral timeline* is used as a space-saving technique. The *perspective timeline* orients itself along the sagittal Z axis, which creates the impression of staring into the depth of the page.[^boyd]

## Variations

### Cicular timeline
A timeline set in parallel coordinated representing time as a cyclical space.

### Parallel timelines
Two or more timelines that are aligned by time stamp and run in parallel to each other depicting contemporaneous events.

### Metaphorical timeline
Timelines stylized as trees with branching limbs, rivers with tributaries, and other natural objects are often found in antique information graphics. Many examples can be found in *Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline*. [^grafton]
