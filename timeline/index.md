is a diagram that displays events along a line in chronological order. Timelines can represent events periods either to scale or display only the sequence of events. Typically, timelines use a linear scale, but for distant events, a logarithmic scale is more suitable.

A timeline uses a line to represent the flow of time and symbols on that line to describe events. The events appear in chronological order spaced to either reflect the time elapsed or spaced at equal intervals.

The orientation of the timeline can be vertical, horizontal, curved, perspective, and spiral.  The *vertical timeline* shows past events at the top and future at the bottom. The *horizontal timeline* runs from left to right. The *curved timeline* runs from left to right and top to bottom, following the standard reading direction and spanning the full width of the available space. The *spiral timeline* is used as a space-saving technique. The *perspective timeline* orients itself along the sagittal Z-axis, which creates the impression of staring into the depth of the page.[^boyd]

Joseph Priestley's 1765 Chart of Biography is cited as the most influential timeline of the 18th century that had the first "complete and fully theorized visual vocabulary for a time map." It became a worthy alternative to visualizing time as tables. [^grafton]

## Variations

### Circular timeline
A timeline set in polar coordinates representing time as cyclical space. This variation is useful for visualizing cyclical events such as seasonal weather patterns.

### Spiral timeline
A timeline with the X-axis following a spiral trajectory. This space-saving layout allows for a data-dense visualization in a small space.

### Metaphorical timeline
Timelines stylized as trees with branching limbs, rivers with tributaries, and other natural objects often appear in vintage information graphics. A collection of such notable examples is the book *Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline*. [^grafton]
