Alternative names: sequence chart

A timeline a a type of charts that displays events in chronological order. Timelines can use a scale or represent events in a sequence without showing the time between events. Timelines covering a relatively small span of time use a linear scale. To display distance events in the past of the future, a logarithmic scale is used.
