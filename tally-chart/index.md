Tally charts show the distribution of data in a group by displaying the occurances of data points in each group. Tally charts are often structured as a table with group names in the first column, the tallies in the second column and a numeric count in the third.

Tallies are often used in scoring for games and sports.

## Alternatives
1. [*Histogram*](/histogram) shows the distribution of one continuous variable represented as the height of bars. Histograms are built using raw data that is split into intervals, called bins. 
2. [*Tape diagram*](/tape-diagram) represents relationships of quantities as corresponding numbers of repeating symbols.
3. [*Pictogram chart*](/pictogram-chart) represents groups of quantities as repreating symbols, often semantically associated with the counted objects.
