is a graphic way of representing the sequence of any operation using nodes and links. [^henderson]

<!--more-->
A flowchart consists of flowchart ***symbols*** and connecting lines. The symbols are standardized, comprised of blocks of various shapes representing input/output, conditional statements, etc. [^myler]

***Connecting lines*** with arrows show the flow of data from one stage or process to the next.  If there is a condition, the "if" is represented by a branching line going towards the alternatives. If the decision involves repeating a previous step, as in a loop, the line
goes back to the decision point; another line shows how the process continues after the loop exits.


The word "flowchart" is often used as a generic name for both technical diagrams such as a block scheme and general-purpose diagrams with connectors.

The flow in a flow chart is that of events, not of time. This allows for simultaneous events.

Aside from programming, flowcharts have been shown to improve the comprehension of law [^marchese] and jury instructions[^semmler].
