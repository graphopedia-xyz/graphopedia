is a graphic way of representing the *sequence* of any *operation* using nodes and links. [^henderson] "Flowchart" is often used a generic name for both technical diagrams such as a block scheme and general-purpose diagrams with connectors. [^chapin]

Flowcharting is used to illustrate programs and algorithms. A standardized system of flowchart symbols is used for this purpose.[^myler] It includes blocks of various shapes to represent input/output, conditional statements, etc. 

For example, the diamond shape represents a decision to be made. Lines with arrows show
the flow of data from one stage or process to the next.  If there is a condition, the “if” is represented by a branching line going towards the alternatives.
If the decision involves repeating a previous step, as in loop, the line
goes back to the decision point; another line shows how the process continues after the loop exits.

The flow in a flow chart is that of events, not of time. This allows for simultaneous events.

Aside from programming, flowcharts have been shown to improve the comprehension of law [^marchese] and jury instructions[^semmler].
