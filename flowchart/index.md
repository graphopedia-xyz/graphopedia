is a type of flowchart where each internal node represents a question about an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (the decision taken). The path connectors from root to leaf represent classification rules.

A decision tree consists of three types of nodes:
- Decision node – represented by squares
- Chance nodes –  represented by circles
- End nodes – represented by triangles
