Alternative name: inline chart

A sparkline is a small chart without axes or coordinates, usually intended to be shown inline with text or as part of small multiples. The purpose of a sparkline is showing variation in a value, such as price. Most commonly, sparklines are line charts. However,the term "sparkline" can also means any embedded contextual information graphic, such as a histogram without scale and axes, for example.
