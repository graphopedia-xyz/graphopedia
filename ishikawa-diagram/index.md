Alternative names: fishbone diagram, herringbone diagram, cause-and-effect diagram, or Fishikawa diagram

An Ishikawa diagram is a type of non-numeric chart that shows cause and effect relationships. Causes are usually grouped into categories that are positioned at the base of each "bone"
in the fishbone. It is called a "fishbone diagram" because of its shape, similar to the side view of a fish skeleton.

### Origin
Ishikawa diagrams were first popularized in the 1960s by Kaoru Ishikawa who used them for quality control in the Kawasaki shipyards. Ishikawa became one of the founding fathers of modern management.
Before Ishikawa, the basic concept was already in use in the 1920s. Mazda Motors used an Ishikawa diagram in the development of the Miata (MX5) sports car.
