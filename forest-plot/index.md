  - title:  trials of the use of corticosteroids to hasten lung development in pre-term babies
    author: Thomas Lumley
    note: This blobbogram uses seven studies to show that corticosteroids can hasten lung development in pregnancies where a baby is likely to be born prematurely. An odds ratio (OR) of one indicates no effect; studies with confidence intervals (horizontal lines) crossing one (vertical line) are inconclusive.
