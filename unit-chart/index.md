Unit charts represent counts by displaying an icon for each element in a group. The the entire group of units represents 100%. The sub-groups are represented with color or another icon.

In a unit chart, the icons are equally spaced such that they number can be estimated visually.

Unit charts are similar to [tape diagrams](/tape-diagram) functionally, however, unit charts tend to arrange icons in rows and columns while tape diagrams only use linear arrangements.
