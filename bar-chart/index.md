A bar chart displays the relationship of a category to a number in the form of a rectangle bar. The bar height along the Y axis or its length along the X axis represents a number.  Each bar represents a single number. For this reason, bar charts can be used to compare discrete numbers but not continuously changing numbers.[^1]

THe bar chart was first introduced by William Playfair. It has become the default choice of chart. The New Work Times graphics Editor Amanda Cox says, "There’s a strand of the data viz world that argues that everything could be a bar chart. That’s possibly true but also possibly a world without joy."[^2]
## Purpose
Most often, bar charts are used to compare the change of a value over time. The basic application os the representation of change in numbers across categories. This is a very broad application which explains the popularity of a bar chart. 
Since the bar chart is often a default, it is worth mentioning what it does not show: distribution, median or mean, ratios, correlation, relationships or connections, or anything more than a single data point.

## Usage
The baseline of a bar chart should always start at zero. Otherwise, the difference between the bars will not be interpreted correctly by the reader who expects it to start at zero. [^3]
The bar width is equal and cannot be used to represent data. Using the width of the bar would turn the bar chart into a [Marimekko Chart](/marimekko-chart). The distance between bars is also equal and not indicative of data values.

Bars can be ordered or unordered.

## Types
Bars can be grouped and stacked. Bars can be oriented around a radial layout making a radial bar chart. The shape of the bar can be substituted with other shapes, as in a lollipop chart.

1. *Grouped bar chart* shows two or more data series where their respective bars are displayed side by side. This types of chart can also be called a "clustered bard chart" or a "multiple bar chart". In this types of chart the bars must be kept the same width since the chart can only show the difference in the height of the bars, not the area.

2. *Stacked bar chart* shows two or more (but in practice the number is quite limited) where each respective bar is stacked on top of the other along the vertical axis.

3. *Radial bar chart* positions the bars along a rounded X axis. Rounded charts are known to be harder to interpret for the human eye than the linear variation.[^5]

4. *Lollipop chart* replaces a bar with a line and a dot at the far end. Lollipop charts may be useful in situations when there are a lot of data points and bars would be either too thin to read or too wide to fit.
