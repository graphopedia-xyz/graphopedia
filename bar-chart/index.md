Alternative name: Column Chart. A bar chart displays quantitative information in the form of rectangles. The length of the bar represents a number. The bar can be either horizontal or vertical.
Most often, bar charts are used to compare the change of a value over time. Each bar represents a single number. For this reason, bar charts can be used to compare discrete numbers but not continuously changing numbers.

### Variations
Many types of chart techniques apply to bar charts: stacking, grouping, 
1. Grouped bar chart shows two or more data series where their respective bars are displayed side by side. This types of chart can also be called a "clustered bard chart" or a "multiple bar chart". In this types of chart the bars must be kept the same width since the chart can only show the difference in the height of the bars, not the area.
2. Stacked bar chart shows two or more (but in practice the number is quite limited) where each respective bar is stacked on top of the other along the vertical axis.
