is a variation of bubble chart with 2 circles per data point. Since bubble charts with a lot of data points tend to become cluttered with overlapping circles, to [de-clutter a bubble chart](https://flowingdata.com/2017/10/26/how-to-make-a-semicircle-plot-in-r/), it is possible to show only half of each circle as shown in [this example from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/01/upshot/cost-of-hurricane-harvey-only-one-storm-comes-close.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0). This chart presumes that the entire circle area is perceived by the reader from seeing its half. This idea is similar to the bands that partially conceal time series graphs in a [horizon plot](/joy-plot#horizon-plot).
