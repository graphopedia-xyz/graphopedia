Alternative name: bubble plot

A <dfn>bubble chart</dfn> is a type of graph that represents three variables by using circles that vary in size and their position on the x and y axes. A bubble chart can be considered a type of scatter plot that adds one more dimention of data that is represented by the circle size.


The circles can be grouped by using color to represent a fourth data dimension. The size of the circles is represented by their area, not the diameter or the radius.

Bubble charts are used to show trends between different categories. The overall shape created by the bubbles of one category compared to that of another is what reveals the data trends in a bubble chart.


A known problem of bubble charts, as well as all types of information graphics that use circles to represent data, is that circle sizes are difficult for a viewer to compare. For this reason, bubble charts are not used for comparing precises values but to show a general trend in the data and the outliers.


Bubble charts do not have a means of representing negative values or zero. An alternative to bubble charts is the mosaic plot, also known as the Marimekko chart or a Mekko chart. The mosaic plot solves the problem of negative values, zeros, and comparison of shapes.


Over-plotting is another issue with bubble charts that comes up when a lor of values are concentrated in one area of the chart or when there are simple too many data points. Making the circles partially transparent can solves this problem for overlap of two to three circles.


### Origin
The bubble chart appeared in William Playfair's <cite>Commercial and Political Atlas</cite> first published in 1786.

### Variations

1. Half-bubble - in order to compare two bubble and to save space, the [bubbles can be substituted with half-circles](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/01/upshot/cost-of-hurricane-harvey-only-one-storm-comes-close.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0).
2. Comparative half-bubble - another variation with the half- circles that allows comparision between two related numbers [displays two half-circles side by side](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/604-the-analytical-tourism-map-of-piedmont).
