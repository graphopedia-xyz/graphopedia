is a technique of thematic mapping that represents density across the entire statistical surface, meaning showing a data point per each unit, most commonly population density.

The dasymetric map was developed in 1911 by Benjamin Semenov-Tyan-Shansky and popularized by American geographer J.K. Wright.

Dasymetric maps are a solution to a known problem of over generalization in choropleth maps. Since choropleth maps only show density at the scale of a geographic or political region and not inside, they can hide the variation within that geographic region which leads readers to assume that the entire region has that density. [^kostelnick] This kind of statistical misrepresentation is known as *ecological fallacy*.

Dasymetric maps show the variation inside the region by using colored symbols, usually rectangles, color to represent change in value by changing color or color hue.

## Alternatives

1. [*Dot map*](/dot-map) shows individual data points represented as dots overlaid over a map.
2. [*Cartogram*](/cartogram) uses distortion of land area to represent data.
