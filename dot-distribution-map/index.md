Alternative name: dot density map

The dot distribution map is a map type that uses a dot symbol to show the presence of a feature emphasizing the distribution of values through the scatter pattern similar to a scatter plot.

### Origin

The dot distribution map was first introduced in the early 1830 by a French monk Armand Joseph Frère de Montizon. The map showed the population of France by administrative district.
