is a type of one-dimensional chart that uses area of a shape to visualize a single variable without the use of axes. A shape, usually a rectangle, is scaled proportionally to the value it represents. The amount typically appears next to the shape. The chart is typically ordered in decreasing order of magnitude.

Proportional area charts communicate a single variable through the area of a figure. Rectangles are the most common shape because estimating their areas is more intuitive for the human eye than areas of circles and other polygons.

Shapes typically align along their bottom edges, which enables the reader to compare their heights.

The chart uses no axes.[^harris] The shapes appear in a line or a grid. The absence of axes makes it possible to use this chart as [small multiples](/small-multiples).

With circular shapes, the area, not the radius, is used. 

Pictographs and illustrations are not the best choices of shape for a proportional area chart since the areas of such complex shapes are not possible to compare effectively.
