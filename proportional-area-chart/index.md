is type one-dimentional chart that uses area to show a single variable without the use of axes. A shape, usually a rectangle, is scaled proportionally to the value it represents. The value is normally written next to the shape.The shapes are normally arranged order in the order of magnitude.

Proportional area charts are communicate a single variable through the area of a figure. Rectangles are the most common shape in this chart because its area is easier to estimate for the human eye than areas of circle or other polygons.

Shapes are normally aligned along their bottom edge such that their heights are easier to compare. 

The chart uses no axes.[^harris] The shapes are normally arranged in a line or in a grid. The absence of axes makes it possible to use this chart as [small multiples](/small-multiples).

if circles are used as shapes, the area, not the radius, is used. To produce circles of the right area, it is possible to use a bubble chart tool such as the one in Adobe illustrator and remove the axes.

Pictographs and illustrations are not a good choice of shape for a proportional area chart since the areas of such complex shapes are not possible to compare effectively.
