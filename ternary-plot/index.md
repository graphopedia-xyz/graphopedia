<!--more-->
A ternary plots shown the relationship of three variables. The values of these three variables must sum up to a constant which is usually represented as 1.0 or 100%.

Ternary plots show the ratios in which three variables relate to each other by occupying a corresponding position on each axis. For this reason, all three axes have to have the same scale that is expressed in the same units.
