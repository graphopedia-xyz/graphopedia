is a triangular diagram where every points is defined using three coordinates. Most ternary plots are drawn on equilateral triangles. 


<!--more-->
A ternary plots shows the relationship of three variables. The values of these three variables must sum up to a constant which is usually represented as 1.0 or 100%.

Ternary plots show the ratios in which three variables relate to each other by occupying a corresponding position on each axis. For this reason, all three axes have to have the same scale that is expressed in the same units.

Ternary diagrams are common in geosciences where they are used to visualize compositional data based on three or more components.
