Gauge charts use a semi-circle divided into sectors to represent ranges of a single variable. The needle points to the current value.

Gauge charts usually use a qualitative scale dividing its curved axis into the excellent, good, moderate, and poor ranges.

Gauge charts are often used in business analytics dashboards, often tracking KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). They are also used as interface elements in apps and websites.

Gauge charts have been criticized as a poor method of visualizing data since the human eye cannot easily compare sectors of a circle, especially where multiple circles are involved.
This criticism is based on the same principle of visual perception as directed to the [pie chart](/pie-chart). The [bullet chart](/bullet-chart) is a linear version of the gauge chart that solves the problem of sector comparison.
