Error bars show variability and uncertainty. In a chart, the error bars may represent the standard deviation (SD) of the data,
the standard error of the mean (SE), a confidence interval, the data range, or percentiles.

Error bars consist of a line, the length of which represents the uncertainty or variability and tick marks that make the ends of the line more apparent. The error bars can appear in different types of charts
