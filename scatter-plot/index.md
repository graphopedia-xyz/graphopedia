Alternative names: scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram

A scatter plot shows values for two variables along the horizontal and vertical axes. With color-coded points, one additional variable can be shown. Scatter plots are used to identify the type of relationship between two quantitative variables. A trendline, also called the line of best fit, can be drawn in order to emphasize the outliers and identify trends. Edward Tufte estimated that between 70-80% of graphs used in scientific publications are scatter plots.

### Origin
The scatter plot first appeared in the work of English statistician Francis Galton (1822-1911) who is also the creator of the concept of correlation in statistics.
