The connected scatter plot chart is useful for visualizing the trend or pattern in the data over a period of time, as well as the relationship between two variables. It can be used to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data, and can be a useful tool for making predictions or identifying trends in the data over time.

The connected scatter plot chart is often used in fields such as finance, economics, and business, where it can be used to analyze trends in data over time and make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the chart. It is also commonly used in scientific fields, such as meteorology and atmospheric science, where it can be used to analyze data collected over time and identify patterns and trends in the data
