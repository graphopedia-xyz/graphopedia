is a type of chart that represents relationships between quantities. The tape diagram is used to solve mathematics word problems by using a repeating unit of measurement. 

<!--more-->
Tape diagrams usually represents a unit with a rectangle. The rectangle is repeated without spaces to represent numbers and ratios. 
The concept of tape diagrams is based on the idea of forming units, a visual representation of numbers and their fractions.[^minds]
The name of the diagram comes from its resemblance to a piece to measuring tape.

Tape diagrams are used for illustrating arithmetic problems as well as for introducing students to algebra. There are two main ways the tape diagrams used: 1. illustrating part-to-whole relationships by drawing a diagram in a single row containing two or more numbers symbols, 2. illustrating comparison of two or more numbers by stacking tape diagrams vertically and aligning their starting points. 
Tape diagrams are considered an effective way to teach proportional thinking. [^cohen]
