is a type of chart that represents relationships between quantities. The tape diagram is used to solve mathematics word problems by using a repeating unit of measurement. 

<!--more-->
Tape diagrams usually represent a unit with a rectangle. The rectangle repeats without spaces to represent numbers and ratios. 
The concept of tape diagrams derives from the idea of forming units, a visual representation of numbers and their fractions.
The name of the chart comes from its resemblance to a piece to measuring tape.

Tape diagrams are used for illustrating arithmetic problems as well as for introducing students to algebra. 

Tape diagrams typically appear in these two use cases:
 1. illustrating part-to-whole relationships by drawing the diagram in a single row containing two or more number symbols; 
2. illustrating comparison of two or more numbers by stacking tape diagrams vertically and aligning their starting points. 
Tape diagrams are considered an effective way of teaching proportional thinking. [^cohen]
