A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which areas are colored to represent the measurement of a variable proportional to the colored area. 


### Origin 
The first choropleth map was introduced by Baron Pierre Charles Dupin in 1826. The term "choropleth map" appeared in 1938 in <cite>Problems in Population Mapping</cite> by the geographer John Kirtland Wright.
