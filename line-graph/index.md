shows trends in data using a line that connects individual data points.  The overall slope of the lines indicates the direction of the pattern of change.

The ***data points*** in a line chart are typically marked as dots unless multiple line charts are shown in the same graph space. The data points are ordered, usually along the ***time or interval axis***. The ***data line*** can be either straight, curved, or stepped.

The value axis of the line chart should start at a zero ***baseline*** since readers rely on the distance from the axis to a data point to read its value. A truncated line chart with the vertical axis starting above zero exaggerates the difference in height for all the other data points, misrepresenting the trend shown in the graph. [^huff]
 
A *line of best fit* is sometimes drawn on the line graph to show how the data points that fit a trend in the data.

Line charts differ from [scatter plots](/scatter-plot) in that the points are ordered and connected by a line, usually along the horizontal axis. 
 
Line charts often visualize a trend in data over intervals of time. In this case, it is called a [time series](/time-series). [^salkind]

The first line chart appeared in 1786 in *The Commercial and Political Atlas* by Scottish engineer William Playfair. [^friendly]


## Variations

### Stepped line chart
<img src="stepped-line-chart.svg" alt="stepped line chart" class="f-right-half" /> Also called *stepped line graph*, a stepped line chart reflects abrupt changes in the data by connecting the data points with two perpendicular lines instead of a straight one. It is often seen in financial charts reflecting the hikes and drops in interest rates and tax rates.

### Spline chart
<img src="spline-chart.svg" alt="spline chart" class="f-right-half" /> Also called *spline graph*, a spline line chart connects the individual data points with a smooth curve rather than a straight line. Even though the spline resembles the [density plot](/density-plot), functionally they have nothing in common. The spline connects individual data points only visually, while density plots use a density estimation function to calculate the probability of data points falling into an interval on the graph. 
 
##Alternative
1. [*Bump chart*](/bump-chart) shows categories ordered by ranking through time.
2. [*Slopegraph*](/slopegraph) shows multiple ranked categories, usually over time or at equal intervals, as a line connecting two values.
3. [*Bar chart*](/bar-chart) shows values as the height of bars, with a bar per category.
