A line chart shows information as a series of data points connected by straight lines.  Line charts differ from scatter plots in that the points are ordered, usually along the horizontal axis. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time. In this case it is called a time series. A line chart should be used when showing a change in data at equal time intervals.

### Origin
Scottish engineer (also secret agent and convicted criminal) William Playfair first published line charts in *The Commercial and Political Atlas* in London in 1786. It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart.
