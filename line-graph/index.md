shows trends in data using a line that connects individual data points.  The overall slope of the lines indicates the direction of the pattern of change.

The ***data points*** in a line chart are typically marked as dots unless multiple line charts are shown in the same graph space. The data points are ordered, usually along the ***time or interval axis***. The ***data line*** can be either straight, curved, or stepped.

The value axis of the line chart should start at a zero ***baseline*** since readers rely on the distance from the axis to a data point to read its value. A truncated line chart with the vertical axis starting above zero exaggerates the difference in height for all the other data points, misrepresenting the trend shown in the graph. [^huff]
 
A *line of best fit* is sometimes drawn on the line graph to show how the data points that fit a trend in the data.

Line charts differ from [scatter plots](/scatter-plot) in that the points are ordered and connected by a line, usually along the horizontal axis. 
 
Line charts often visualize a trend in data over intervals of time. In this case, it is called a [time series](/time-series). [^salkind]

The first line chart appeared in 1786 in *The Commercial and Political Atlas* by Scottish engineer William Playfair. [^friendly]
