is a type of [line chart](/line-graph) for multiple categories that are ranked, usually through time.

<!--more-->
The "bumps chart" was created by Tim Granger using 14 years of data from the Cambridge "Bumps" races which is a rowing team tournament. In his book *Beautiful Evidence*, Edward Tufte cites this particular chart as an example of "800 interwoven [sparklines](/sparkline)" meaning this chart is data-rich.[^tufte]

In software packages such as Tableau, the chart is now called "bump chart." [^sleeper]

Bump charts have no axes, unlike a stacked line graph. Categories are labeled at the begining and end of each row so that the initial and final rankings are evident. The time intervals are labeled for each vertical. The line graph for each category is reordered according to the rank for each time interval.

Bump charts emphasize ranking through time. The time is normally displayed at equal intervals. Bump charts can also be thought of as [slopegraphs](/slopegraph) with a time dimension.

The dots or circles drawn at each point where the line graph passes through the time vertical are not required.
