- name: picturing
  description: shows configuration and visual appearance of entities or scenes in the physical world (existing or imagined), using methods such as perspective projection.
  type: arranging
  id: PIC

- name: mapping
  description: shows locations within the two-dimensional layout (typically horizontal) of physical configurations (existing or imagined), using methods such as cartographic projection.
  type: arranging
  id: MAP

- name: positioning along a coordinate axis
  description: shows quantities or points in time by arrangement along an axis with a measurement scale.
  type: arranging
  hasDirection: true
  id: AXI

- name: extending along a coordinate axis
  description: (showing ranges)
  type: arranging
  variantOf: AXI
  hasDirection: true
  id: EXT

- name: diverging along a coordinate axis
  description: (in opposite dir.)
  type: arranging
  variantOf: AXI
  hasDirection: true
  id: DIV

- name: ranging along a coordinate axis
  description: (spanning 2 values)
  type: arranging
  variantOf: AXI
  hasDirection: true
  id: RAN

- name: ternary positioning along three axes
  description: (in ternary plots)
  type: arranging
  variantOf: AXI
  hasDirection: true
  id: TER

- name: proportional space-filling
  description: shows proportions of a total by sizing and arranging partitions (or repeating and arranging blocks) into a contiguous total surface area.
  type: arranging
  hasDirection: true
  id: PSF

- name: ordering
  description: shows order by arrangement into a sequential spatial order, or into spatially ordered levels of indenting.
  type: arranging
  hasDirection: true
  id: ORG

- name: grouping by position
  description: shows category membership by spatial proximity or alignment.
  type: arranging
  hasDirection: true
  id: GRP

- name: coupling by adjacency
  description: shows the presence of a given relationship between two entities by placing one visual component next to another visual component (from the same set1). In the case of a linear non-branching sequence of components, we speak of ordering rather than coupling by adjacency.
  type: arranging
  id: ADJ

- name: nesting
  description: shows the presence of a given hierarchical (or sequential) relationship between two entities by spatial containment of one visual component within another (from the same set1). Usually, nesting comes with grouping by boundary and it is the boundaries (around components) that are nested (creating levels of containment).
  type: arranging
  id: NES

- name: connecting
  description: shows the presence of a given relationship between two entities through the use of a configurator component that establishes a pathway between two visual components (from the same set1), e.g. two symbols connected with a line or arrow.
  type: linking
  id: CON

- name: grouping by boundary
  description: shows category membership (or the presence of a given relationship between two entities) by grouping visual components using a configurator component such as a demarcating line, enclosure or shared background.
  type: linking
  id: BOU

- name: sizing
  description: shows quantities or order by varying the surface area of visual components.
  type: varying
  hasDirection: true
  id: SIZ

- name: sizing of bars
  type: varying
  variantOf: SIZ
  id: SBA

- name: sizing of partitions
  type: varying
  variantOf: SIZ
  id: SPA

- name: sizing band width
  type: varying
  variantOf: SIZ
  id: SBW

- name: repeating
  description: shows quantities or order by the use of multiples of visual components.
  type: varying
  id: REP

- name: gradient coding
  description: shows order by the use of gradated differences in brightness or saturation, transparency, fuzziness, etc.
  type: varying
  id: GRA

- name: colour coding
  description: shows category membership by the use of colour.
  type: varying
  id: COL

- name: shape coding
  description: shows category membership by the use of shape.
  type: varying
  id: SHA

  description: (in parallel coordinates and radar charts)
  type: layout principle
