is a method of visualizing numbers by repeating identical pictographs that refer to objects and concepts that describe the data being visualized. This makes ISOTYPE more memorable than abstract shapes normally used for statistical graphs. These pictographs are standardized and abstracted symbols that are combined following a set of rules.

ISOTYPE, an acronym for "International System Of Typographic Picture Education", appeared around 1935. Its creator Otto Neurath was a statistician and a philosopher.

***Function:*** mnemonic device

***Data:*** one variable (univariate)
