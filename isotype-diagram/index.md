Isotype is a method of showing numbers by repeating identical pictographs that refers to objects and concepts. These pictographs are standardized and abstracted symbols that are combined following a set of rules.

### Origin

Isotype, acronym for "International System Of Typographic Picture Education", appeared around 1935 to replace what used to be called the Vienna Method, when its creator Otto Neurath was forced to leave Vienna by the rise of Austrian fascism.
