is a type of chart used in technical analysis to track the price movements of a security or financial instrument. It is a graphical representation of price movements that is used to identify trends and patterns in the data.

<!--more-->

The point and figure chart consists of a series of vertical columns, with each column representing a specific price range. When the price of the security or financial instrument moves up or down within the range, it is represented by a series of Xs or Os, respectively. The Xs represent an upward price movement, while the Os represent a downward price movement. The chart does not use time as a unit of measurement, and instead focuses solely on the price movements of the security or financial instrument.

Point and figure charts are useful for identifying trends and patterns in the data and can be used to make informed decisions about buying or selling a security or financial instrument. They are often used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and oscillators, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the data.
