is a type of non-numeric diagram that consists of concentric circles representing categories. Each outer ring represents a category that includes all of its inner circles.

Onion diagrams are used to describe the relationship of several ***categories*** where one broad category is the "outer layer" that includes narrower categories represented by "inner layers."

The onion diagram does not represent quantities of its categories, but only their loose relationship to each other by using the metaphorical layers.

In psychology, an example of a well-known and widely-cited onion diagram is the "The “Onion”: Manifestations of Culture at Different Levels of Depth" [^hofstede] which describes the inner drives and outer manifestations of a culture.

Onion diagrams are used to illustrate relationships between several categories, but with more than a few circles, the chart's readability declines.

The onion diagram can be thought of as a Euler diagram where each set has only one subset.

## Alternatives
Other metaphor-based diagrams can be used to show relationships between categories.
1. [*Funnel chart*](/funnel-chart) starts with the top category, that represents 100%. The lower segments of the funnel represent some percentage of the top segment with a decreasing pattern.
2. [*Pyramid diagram*](/pyramid-diagram) starts at the bottom with the bottom segment representing 100% and the upper segments representing some percentage of the bottom.
