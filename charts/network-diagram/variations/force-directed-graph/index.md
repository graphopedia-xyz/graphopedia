is a graphical representation of a network or system in which the elements are represented by nodes, and the connections between the elements are represented by links. The layout of the diagram is generated using a force-directed algorithm, which positions the nodes in a way that minimizes the overall length of the links while also trying to evenly distribute the nodes in the available space.

In a network diagram with a force directed layout, the nodes are typically arranged in a way that reflects the strength or importance of the connections between them. Stronger connections are usually depicted with shorter, thicker links, while weaker connections are depicted with longer, thinner links. The layout of the diagram can be adjusted to highlight different aspects of the network, such as the relationships between different groups of nodes or the overall structure of the network. Network diagrams with force directed layouts are often used to visualize and analyze complex systems, networks, or relationships, and can be used in fields such as computer science, data analysis, and social sciences.
