wraps the X-axis around the center in a spiral. This variation is useful for showing large data sets in a space-saving format. Spiral bar charts are less readable than the linear kind.  In a situation where indicating the exact values is less important than showing a trend, a spiral bar chart has the advantage of displaying a lot of data points at once. If the X-axis shows time, the more recent events are typically plotted on the outer coil going inward.
