is a variation of the lollipop chart displaying two data points per category. The line connecting them emphasizes the difference between the two data points. Functionally, it is the same as the range bar chart. With large data sets it has the advantage of displaying data more compactly. The dots are typically colored such that they are more visible than the lines.
