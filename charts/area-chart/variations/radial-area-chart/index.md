A radial area chart is an area chart plotted in polar coordinates. Even though it is visually similar to the [radar chart](/radar-chart), its function is different. The radar chart's radial axes each represent a different variable, while a radial area chart plots the same variable on the X-axis curving around a central point.  Radial charts are useful for showing cyclical data, for example, seasonal weather patterns.
