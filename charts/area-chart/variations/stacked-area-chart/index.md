Stacked area chart shows multiple data curves and fills the area between them. The curve with less variation is typically drawn at the bottom, closer to the X-axis. Stacked area charts are known to be difficult to perceive because the human eye does not judge area shown relative to a curved line as well as relative to a straight line.[^thud] The fill in a stacked area chart is necessary for readability.
