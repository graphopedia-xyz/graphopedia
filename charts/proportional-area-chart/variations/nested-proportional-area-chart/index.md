overlap the shapes to facilitate comparison between them. The nested shapes are typically aligned either at their bottom edge or in the lower left corner. The nesting tends to negatively impact the chart's readability. At the same time, the chart becomes more compact.

A common use case is the legend of a bubble chart or a [proportional symbol map](/bubble-map).
