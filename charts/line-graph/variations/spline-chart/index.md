connects the individual data points with a smooth curve rather than a straight line. Even though the spline resembles the [density plot](/density-plot), functionally they have nothing in common. The spline connects individual data points only visually, while density plots use a density estimation function to calculate the probability of data points falling into an interval on the graph.
