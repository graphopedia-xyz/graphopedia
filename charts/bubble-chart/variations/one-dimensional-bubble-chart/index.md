uses only one axis and the scaled circles to represent two variables. Without one of the axes it loses the properties of a scatter plot that allow it to show correlations. Functionally, this type of bubble chart is more similar to a [beeswarm plot](/strip-plot#beeswarm-plot). The scaled circles are usually displayed using a force-directed layout, which is a visual arrangement that avoids any overlap of circles while changing the circle position. This positioning can shift the circles from their positions on the axis which makes this chart prone to misrepresentation.
