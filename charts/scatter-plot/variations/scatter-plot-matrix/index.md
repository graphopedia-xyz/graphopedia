is a type of chart that displays multiple scatterplots in a matrix format. 

<!--more-->
Each scatterplot in the matrix represents the relationship between two different variables. The variables are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis of each scatterplot, and the points on the scatterplot represent individual data points. The scatterplot matrix allows you to visualize the relationships between multiple variables at once, and can be useful for identifying patterns and trends in your data. It can also be used to identify potential correlations between variables, which can be further explored through statistical analysis.
