The Kagi chart shows price movements independly of time. This feature makes the Kagi a cleaner representation of the change in price and sentiment than the Candlestick chart.
A Kagi chart is made of with a series of vertical lines connected by short horizontal lines. The color, thickness, and direction of the lines is based on the price. The thickness/color of the line changes when the price reaches the high or low of the previous vertical line.
The direction of the line changes when the price reaches a preset reversal amount, which is usually set at 4%. When a direction change occurs, a short horizontal line is drawn between the lines of opposite direction.

### Origin

The Kagi chart originates from Japan where during the 1870s it was used in stock market started trading.
