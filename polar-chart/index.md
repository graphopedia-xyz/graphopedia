is a type of [pie chart](/pie-chart) in which all sectors have equal angles differing only in how far each segment extends from the center of the circle. [^friendly]  The data is represented as the area, not the height, of a sector.

<!--more-->
Each ***segment*** of a polar area chart represents a value through its area, not arc length or radius. The segments can be stacked, similar to a stacked bar chart, except that they are presented in polar coordinates.

The polar area chart is used to plot circular data[^fisher].

Cyclical phenomena, such as monthly weather patterns, are the best use case of the polar area chart. However, the drawback of the polar chart is that it makes the outer segments seem more significant. 

The difficulty in interpreting this chart comes from the limits of human perception to correctly estimate areas of circles and their sectors.

The polar area chart is not to be confused with a [radial bar chart](/bar-chart#radial-bar-chart). It also laid out radially, but it uses the bar length, not the area, to represent a value.
