is a combination of a map and a [flowchart](/flowchart) or a [Sankey diagram](sankey-chart) that shows the movement of objects from one location to another. 

<!--more-->
Flow maps are used for showing connections between the origin of moving objects and their destinations.  The flow map can have weighted or unweighted connecting lines. The weight refers to the width of the line. Flow maps with weighted connections typically show migration, trade, and data transfers between locations.[^phan] It can be either directional showing movement in a single direction or non-directional, presuming that the movement is happening in both directions. [^harris]

A known challenge in flow map design is the visual clutter made by intersecting flow lines. The solution is in routing the connecting lines such that every child connector branches out from the main flow at a point when it is the closest to its destination. [^tamassia]

The first flow maps are attributed to Henry Drury Harness who created a detailed atlas of the Irish Railways in 1837. [^tamassia]
