is a type of visualization used to represent a flow of any kind, where the width of each arrow corresponds to the quantity of the flow. Sankey diagrams put a visual focus on the transfers or flows within a system [1]. 
Sankey chart is represented by arrows, which width corresponds to the magnitude of the flow [3]. Flow arrows or lines can merge or split at each stage of a process. Color can be used to separate the chart into different categories or to show the transition from one state of the process to another.

## Origin
Sankey chart is named after the Irish engineer Riall Sankey. He created a diagram of steam engine efficiency that used arrows having widths proportional to heat loss [2].

## Variations
- **Alluvial diagram** is a type of Sankey diagram that uses the same kind of representation to depict how items re-group.
- **Grassmann diagram** is the same as the Sankey diagram, but it mainly depicts energy transformations in thermodynamics.
