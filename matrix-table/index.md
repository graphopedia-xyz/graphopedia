is a grid-based table where every cell has two values based on its row and column position.

<!--more-->
A table is a rectangular arrangement or intersections rows and columns in which every resulting cell is assigned one of more data points.

Tables are one of the most versatile information design methods. They can often display information that is otherwise not possible to show on a graph. [^harris]

## Variations

### adjacency matrix
A square matrix where columns and rows have the same values in a sequence. The intersection of the rows and columns indicated if a relationship is present. Color-coding can be used to indicate the strength of the relationship.
