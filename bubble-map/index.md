shows numeric values associated with locations on a geographic map using scaled circles. A bubble map is a type of proportional symbol map. The value is the area of each circle, not the diameter or the radius, following the same principle as in a bubble chart. The underlying map is divided into regions, with a single circle per region.

In infographics and data visualizations, bubble maps need to be properly scaled to avoid clutter. Ideally, bubbles should not overlap. To avoid obstruction of the map itself, bubbles can be made partially transparent.
