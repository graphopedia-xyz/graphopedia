is a type of thematic map used for plotting transit systems. In information design, it can be used as a metaphor to depict flows and junctions systems other than transportation.

<!--more-->
The idea behind a transit map is that it is a universally understood visualization of route lines, stations, and junctions. The equal spacing between the stations makes this map easier to read than traditional maps with proportional spacing.[^guo]

Using the abstraction of lines, stations and junctions, a transit map can be used by analogy to describe other systems.

The usage of a transit map in infographic design relies on the reader's familiarity with how this map works and on the analogy between the transportation system and other systems that have flow such as the human circulatory system, for example.
