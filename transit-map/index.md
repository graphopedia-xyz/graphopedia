is a type of information visualization that uses the metaphor of a subway map with equally spaced stations to depict another subject.

<!--more-->
The idea behind a transit map is that there is a sequence in which the stations appear and some stations are transfer stations. The equal spacing between the stations makes this map easier to read than maps with proportional spacing.

The structure of a transit map is based on the abstraction of routes ot subway lines, stations, and transfer stations of junctions where the routes interset.

The usage of a transit map in infographic design relies on the reader's familiarity with how this map works and on the analogy between the transportation system and other systems that have flow such as the human circulatory system, for example.
