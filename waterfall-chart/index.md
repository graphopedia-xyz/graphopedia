is a type of [bar chart](/bar-chart) that tracks the change from an initial value through a series of intermediate positive or negative values to the end value. The first column is an initial value, the last column is a cumulative total.  
<!--more-->
In a waterfall chart, the first value is represented with a bar, exactly as in a bar chart. The subsequent values are shown as bars that start where the previous bar ended. The intermediate bars reflect the change between a column and its neighboring columns. Each intermediate bar either rises above the previous bar reflecting positive change or descends below reflecting negative change. 

The intermediate bars form a cascading pattern that resembles a waterfall.

## Alternatives
1. [*Bar chart*](/bar-chart) uses rectangles height to relate two variables. Functionally it is the same as the waterfall chart[^borkin] but the visual focus is not on the change between bars.
2. [*Area chart*](/area-chart) uses the area between the X axis and the data line. It is an alternative because the variation in the line would also emphasize change.
3. [*Line chart*](/line-chart) uses data points connected by a straight line. The overall shape reveals the change pattern.
