A waterfall chart is a type of bar chart that shows how an initial value is affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative values. The first column is an initial value, the last column is a cumulative total. The intermediate columns are change columns. Each intermediate column can be either positive or negative with its edge positioned such that it is at the same vertical height as the current cumulative “total” and another, opposite edge is above (for positive change columns) or below (for negative change columns) the first edge by a vertical dimension that is proportional to the degree of change that has occurred. The change columns appear to “cascade" relative to the first and the final columns. Similar to a Kagi chart, change columns change color depending on whether the change is positive or negative.
