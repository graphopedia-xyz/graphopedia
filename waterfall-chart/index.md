is a type of [bar chart](/bar-chart) that tracks the change from an initial value through a series of intermediate values to the end value. The first column is the initial value. The last column is a cumulative total.  The intermediate values reflect positive or negative changes.
<!--more-->
In a waterfall chart, the first value appears as a bar, exactly as in a bar chart. A subsequent value shows up as a bar starting where the previous bar ended. 

The intermediate bars reflect the change between a column and its neighboring columns. Each intermediate bar either rises above the previous bar reflecting a positive change or descends below reflecting a negative change. 

The chart has its name from the intermediate bars that make up a cascading pattern resembling a waterfall.

## Alternatives
1. [*Bar chart*](/bar-chart) uses rectangles height to relate two variables. Functionally it is the same as the waterfall chart[^borkin], but the visual focus is not on the change between bars.
2. [*Area chart*](/area-chart) uses the area between the X-axis and the data curve. It is an alternative because the variation in the area would also emphasize change.
3. [*Line chart*](/line-chart) uses data points connected by a straight line. The overall shape reveals the changing pattern.
