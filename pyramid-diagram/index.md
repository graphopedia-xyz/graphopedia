is a type of non-numeric visualization for hierarchies and groups. Pyramids are a metaphor for quantities or qualities scarce at the top but abundant at the bottom of a hierarchy. The bottom of the pyramid represents the largest group. The top shows the smallest group. The pyramid sections are usually not sized proportionally to represent numeric data.

Pyramid charts are useful as visual aids [^solon] in classrooms and in presentations.

Even though some software programs create pyramid charts based on numeric data, the pyramid diagram only suits metaphoric use. Graphs such as the [stacked bar chart](/bar-chart) visualize quantities without the confusion of pyramid diagrams [^su].

Some of the most well-known pyramid charts in science are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. 

The [population pyramid](/population-pyramid) chart is a similarly named but an unrelated chart that is a dual histogram, usually used for showing population trends.
