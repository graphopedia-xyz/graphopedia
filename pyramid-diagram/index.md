is type of non-numeric visualization of hierarchies and groups. The pyramid is a metaphor for any quantities or qualities that are scarce at the top and abundant at the bottom of the hierarchy. The bottom of the pyramid represents the largest group. The top shows the smallest group. The pyramid sections are usually not sized to represent numeric data.

Pyramid charts are used as learning aids [^solon] in classrooms as well as visual aids in presentations.

Even though some software programs create pyramid charts based on numeric data, it is best to use other charts such as a stacked bar chart to represent the numbers[^su] and separately use the pyramid diagram as a metaphor.

Some of the most well-known pyramid charts in science are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the USDA Food Guide Pyramid published in 1992.
