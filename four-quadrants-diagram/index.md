is a graphical representation that divides a two-dimensional space into four quadrants. Each quadrant represents a distinct category or group, and the data or elements being plotted are placed in the appropriate quadrant based on their characteristics or attributes.

<!--more-->

In a four quadrant diagram, the x- and y-axes represent two variables or dimensions, and the intersection of the two axes is the center of the diagram. The four quadrants are typically labeled with the names or descriptions of the categories or groups they represent. Data points or elements are plotted in the quadrant that corresponds to their category or group.

Four quadrant diagrams are often used to visualize and analyze data or relationships in fields such as business, marketing, and psychology. They can be used to compare and contrast different elements or groups, identify patterns or trends, or illustrate the distribution of data across different categories or groups.
