is a graphical tool used in statistical analysis to display the relationship between the precision of a study and its effect size. It is often used to assess the risk of bias in a meta-analysis, which is a statistical technique that combines the results of multiple studies on a particular topic.

Introduced by Light and Pillemer in 1984, the funnel plot is constructed by plotting the effect size of each study on the horizontal axis and the precision of the study (usually measured by the standard error of the effect size estimate) on the vertical axis. The resulting plot takes the shape of an inverted funnel, with the wider end at the bottom representing studies with low precision and the narrow end at the top representing studies with high precision.

If the studies included in the meta-analysis are unbiased, the funnel plot should be symmetrical and the points should be evenly distributed around the overall effect size estimate. If the plot is asymmetrical or the points are not evenly distributed, it may indicate the presence of bias in the studies included in the meta-analysis. Funnel plots can be useful for detecting and addressing bias in meta-analyses and for evaluating the overall quality of the evidence in a particular field of research. They can also be used in other contexts, such as to compare the precision and effect size of different studies within a single field of research or to assess the generalizability of research findings.
