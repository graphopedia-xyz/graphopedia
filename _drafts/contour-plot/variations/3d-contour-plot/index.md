        <p>In 2D Contour Plots, 3-dimensional data is displayed in a 2D chart to display the potential relationships between three variables. The two predictor variables are plotted on the X and Y scales, while the response variable is represented by the varying colour shades on the plot. So for example, dark regions could represent high Z-axis values and light regions could represent low Z-axis values.</p>
