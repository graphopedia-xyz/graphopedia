is a variation of the [bar chart](/bar-chart) with an added symbol for the target value and a progress bar that approaches the target. The bullet chart includes qualitative ranges labeled from "bad" to "good", and "excellent". The bullet chart was created as an alternative to gauge charts used in dashboards. The bullet chart was invented by American author Stephen Few as a response to gauge charts.[^few] The bullet charts allow for easier comparison of values when positioned next to each other than the gauge charts.

## Purpose
 The purpose of the bullet chart is comparison of a value to its target. When several bullet charts are used in an infographic or a dashboard, their use allows for easier comparison of values between charts than gauge charts would allow.
 The bullet chart is not designed to display a lot of data points. For a dashboard or an infographic with dozens of data points and their targets, it may be better to use a [scatter plot](/scatter-plot).
 
 ##Usage
 Bullet charts are relatively new, and yet readers seem to understand them well because their shape reminds one of a thermometer.[^metoyer]
 The bullet chart can display negative values, which are plotted to the left or towards the bottom. [^few2]
 
 
 ##Alternative charts
 1. [*Bar chart*](/bar-chart) shows values as lengths of bars. A stacked bar chart can reflect the target and current values similar to a bullet chart.
 
 2. *Gauge chart* shows values as a needle on a speedometer. The target value is usually marked.
