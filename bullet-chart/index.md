The bullet chart is a variation of the bar chart with an added symbol for the target and a progress bar that approaches the target. The bullet chart is an efficient alternative to gauge charts that are used in dashboards.

Origin
The bullet chart is invented by American author Stephen Few as a response to gauge charts used in dashboard design.
