Treemap is a type of chart that displays hierarchical data using nested figures, usually rectangles. Any tree map can also be represented as a tree diagram. Each parent node on a tree diagram is represented as a larger rectangle that contains a smaller rectangle that is a child node. This recursive construction allows the tree map to visualize hierarchical data with any number of levels.

## Origin
This idea was invented by professor Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human â€“ Computer Interaction Lab in the early 1990s.

## Variations
- **Voronoi Treemaps** based on Voronoi diagram calculations. 
- **Jigsaw Treemaps** based on the geometry of space-filling curves. They assume that the weights are integers and that their sum is a square number. The regions of the map are rectilinear polygons and highly non-ortho-convex. Their aspect ratio is guaranteed to be at most 4.
- **GosperMaps** based on the geometry of Gosper curves. It is ordered and stable, but has a very high aspect ratio.
