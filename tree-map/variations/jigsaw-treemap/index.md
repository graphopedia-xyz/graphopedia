cuts rectangles of a treemap into equally-sized squares and then reassembles them into jigsaw-resembling shapes that are fitted without gaps. This layout allows every leaf node to be roughly square and therefore, legible and selectable. [^wattenberg] The tradeoff is the unfamiliar shapes that readers cannot easily evaluate, either for the area or for tree topology.
